# Problem 4: Online Judges at Logistic Solutions

## 1. Problem

Several students from the **Institute of Computing at UFBA** are preparing to participate in the **Brazilian Programming Marathon (SBC)** ([http://maratona.sbc.org.br](http://maratona.sbc.org.br)). In this competition, teams submit source code to solve problems, using evaluation systems known as **Online Judges (OJ)**.

An OJ assesses the code by running multiple test cases and returning one of the following results:

1. **AC – Accepted**: Passed all test cases.
2. **WA – Wrong Answer**: Incorrect answer in at least one test case.
3. **TLE – Time Limit Exceeded**: Program exceeded the time limit.
4. **CE – Compilation Error**: Program failed to compile (warnings are not errors).
5. **RE – Runtime Error**: Program crashed due to issues like invalid memory access or division by zero.

During marathon training, student Carlos encountered an interesting OJ problem related to logistics — the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**. He shared it with his startup team at **Logistic Solutions**, who began submitting code for it. After correcting compilation and runtime errors (CE and RE) and eliminating wrong answers (WA), all submissions still returned the same result: **TLE**.

Despite the team’s experience, they started to wonder:

* Was it a logic flaw or an inadequate approach?
* What strategies could lead to an **AC** result for the TSP?

Additionally, the startup managers became interested in the OJ's functionality and asked Carlos to investigate:

* Whether the OJ can evaluate other types of problems.
* Whether the OJ can detect if a program will enter an **infinite loop**.

Carlos brought these questions to his teammates in the **Theory of Computation** course. They realized that OJ behavior could be modeled using a **Finite State Machine (FSM)** to:

* Represent transitions between different evaluation outcomes (AC, WA, TLE, etc.).
* Illustrate how the OJ works and explain its logic to both programmers and management.

The main challenge is to:

1. Analyze why the TSP codes return **TLE**, and how to achieve **AC**.
2. Design a **Finite State Machine** that represents the OJ’s logic and explains its limitations, especially the theoretical impossibility of detecting infinite loops.

## 2. Deliverables

The team must submit a **report in SBC article format** containing all analyses and results. Submission is due via **UFBA Moodle** by **11:59 PM on 27/06/2022**. The report must include:

1. **Team discussions about the TSP in the OJ**:

   * Hypotheses regarding the results of the code submissions.
   * Characterization of the TSP: its definition, computational challenges, and possible causes for the TLE results.

2. **Responses to the startup managers**:

   * Detailed answers to the startup’s questions, supported by explanations and demonstrations.
   * Discussion on OJ’s capabilities and limitations, especially regarding detection of infinite loops.

3. **FSM representing OJ behavior**:

   * A model of the OJ using a **Finite State Machine**, including states, transitions, and conditions representing outputs like AC, WA, TLE, etc.
   * Explanation of how the FSM clarifies system operation and constraints.

The report must be clear, well-organized, and connect practical issues to the theoretical concepts from the course.
