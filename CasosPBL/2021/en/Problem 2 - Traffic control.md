## **Task: Traffic Control**

### **1. Introduction**

One of the problems affecting Brazilian highways is the **large number of potholes.** There are many causes for this issue: **the alternation between rain and sun** is one of them. Another reason is **the pressure exerted by heavy vehicles** on the roads during the night, a period when these vehicles move more freely on the highways. On the Aratu Road in Salvador, many potholes have been identified by technicians from the **Bahia Department of Transport Infrastructure (DERBA),** causing various incidents and occasionally serious accidents.

The technicians at this department believe it is possible to reduce pressure on the pavement and, consequently, minimize the problem of potholes if they have access to daily reports on the number of vehicles traveling on the road at night.

Based on this data, the idea is to create **a pavement wear prevention plan.** The technicians classify vehicles into three categories: **light, heavy, and very heavy.** Vehicles weighing **up to six (6) tons** are categorized as **light;** those **above six (6) tons but below ten (10) tons** are categorized as **heavy;** and those weighing **ten (10) tons or more** are categorized as **very heavy.**

Additionally, there are already sensors installed at the entrance and exit of the Aratu Road that allow vehicles to be identified and categorized. The technicians would like a solution that, based on the information from these sensors, **can determine how many vehicles from each category traveled during the previous night** and **identify which category had the most vehicles.**

The current cohort of the Theory of Computation class is studying Turing Machines and believes **they can design a system with such functionalities.** As a result, they contacted DERBA technicians **to offer some solutions to this problem.**

### 2. Process

During the solution development process, the **Problem-Based Learning (PBL)** methodology will be employed. This approach uses real-world problems to stimulate the development of critical thinking, teamwork, and problem-solving skills, while also contributing to the construction of knowledge about a specific topic.

The process must be documented using the **PBL whiteboard**, which is structured into the columns: **QUESTIONS, FACTS, IDEAS/HYPOTHESES, and ACTIONS.** At each team meeting, a new version of the whiteboard should be created, documenting the steps taken toward the solution. Additionally, a shared document will be provided for the completion of a **Logbook**, which must include meeting minutes with participant names, discussion points, and challenges encountered. 

The description of this process will be part of the group evaluation. During this process, the participation and contribution of each team member are fundamental. Each student will also be individually assessed based on tutor observations and peer feedback.

### **3. Deliverable**

You are required to upload to Moodle UFBA by **6:00 PM on January 12, 2020**, in the designated area: 

1. One or more files containing **Turing Machines** (in JFLAP format) that provide a solution to the problem.

2. A detailed **report**, formatted according to the SBC article guidelines, thoroughly describing the functionality of the proposed traffic control system.


### **4. Knowledge/Concepts Involved**

    1. Turing Machines

    2. Variations of Turing Machines

    3. Church-Turing Thesis


### **5. Learning Objectives**

#### **5.1 General Objective**  
Develop Turing Machines to compute solutions for "real-world" problems, such as the DERBA problem.

#### **5.2 Specific Objectives**  
1. **Identify** the functionalities required by the system as envisioned by the user.  

2. **Reconcile** the desired user functionalities with the capabilities of the Turing Machine to be developed.  

3. **Evaluate** the need for extensions or variations in the Turing Machine to meet the system's requirements.  

4. **Apply** the Church-Turing thesis by associating the formal concept of a Turing Machine with the intuitive notion of an algorithm.
