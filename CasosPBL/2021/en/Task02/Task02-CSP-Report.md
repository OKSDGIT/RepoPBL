# Competency Specification Report: Task02 – Traffic Control

## Introduction

This report applies the **Competency Specification Process (CSP)** to the Problem-Based Learning (PBL) scenario entitled **"Traffic Control"**, which engages students in designing a computational solution using **Turing Machines** to address vehicle monitoring and classification on highways. The task integrates formal methods and systems thinking to model a real-world problem posed by the Department of Transport Infrastructure.

Through the CSP methodology, competencies are extracted and structured based on the analysis of the task description, relevant knowledge domains, learning objectives, and behavioral dispositions. The goal is to define a robust competency framework aligned with both **technical skill development** and **collaborative problem solving**.



## 1. Task Description Analysis

The *Traffic Control* task challenges students to develop a formal computational solution that addresses a real-world issue identified by the **Department of Transport Infrastructure**: the deterioration of highways due to excessive pressure from nighttime heavy vehicle traffic.

To support pavement wear prevention efforts, students must design a system capable of:

* **Processing sensor data** collected from vehicle entries and exits on the Aratu highway;
* **Classifying vehicles** into three weight categories (light, heavy, and very heavy);
* **Counting occurrences** for each category during the previous night; and
* **Identifying the most frequent category**, enabling the Department of Transport Infrastructure to prioritize interventions.

The system must be modeled using **Turing Machines**, reflecting a theoretical yet expressive model of computation. Deliverables include one or more **JFLAP-based Turing Machine files** and a **technical report** compliant with SBC formatting standards, clearly explaining the classification logic, design rationale, and simulation process.

This task requires learners to:

* **Translate user-defined goals** into formal system specifications based on computability theory;
* **Model real-world constraints** (e.g., sensor input structure, weight classification logic) using Turing Machines;
* **Evaluate the use of Turing Machine variants** (e.g., multi-tape, non-deterministic) when standard models are insufficient;
* **Simulate and test** the model using appropriate tools to ensure functional correctness;
* **Collaborate effectively** during the problem-solving process, documenting all steps and decisions in a structured and reflective manner.

Through this problem-based learning scenario, students are expected to integrate **theoretical knowledge of computation** with **practical modeling and simulation**, producing a solution that is both educationally rigorous and socially relevant.




## 2. Knowledge Enumeration

To successfully complete the *Traffic Control* task, students must mobilize a set of interrelated theoretical and professional knowledge domains. These domains are aligned with recognized taxonomies: the **ACM Computing Classification System (2012)** for computing knowledge and the **ACM/IEEE CC2020** for professional competencies.

This knowledge foundation ensures that the problem is addressed not only from a technical perspective but also through analytical reasoning, formal specification, and effective communication.

### Computing Knowledge

* **Turing Machines**
  * Fundamental for representing the computational process required to classify vehicles and compute frequency statistics. Students must understand the structure, behavior, and expressive power of Turing Machines to encode real-world operations in a formal model.

* **Turing Machine Variants (Turing Machines)**
  * Knowledge of multi-tape or non-deterministic Turing Machines is essential when standard models are insufficient for performance or expressiveness. Variants allow for more efficient data manipulation and system simulation under complex constraints.

* **Church-Turing Thesis**
  * Provides the theoretical basis for the task, reinforcing the equivalence between algorithmic reasoning and Turing-computable functions. Students are expected to ground their solutions in this foundational concept.

* **Requirements Analysis**
  * Enables the identification, analysis, and formalization of user needs (e.g., Department of Transport Infrastructure’s demand for nighttime traffic classification) into computational requirements that guide system design.

* **Modeling and Simulation**
  * Involves abstracting system behaviors into formal representations and validating them through tools such as **JFLAP**. This knowledge area supports iterative refinement and verification of the proposed solution.

### Professional Knowledge (FPK)

* **Analytical and Critical Thinking**
  * Required to deconstruct the problem context (e.g., traffic monitoring and classification) into actionable components, and to formulate logical models that meet stakeholder expectations.

* **Problem Solving and Troubleshooting**
  * Essential for addressing implementation issues, such as handling non-standard input formats, optimizing tape usage, or debugging Turing Machine simulations.

* **Written Communication**
  * Needed to produce a well-structured and technically sound report that documents the design rationale, implementation decisions, and validation strategies. This ensures that results are effectively communicated to technical and non-technical audiences, such as Department of Transport Infrastructure.

## Conclusion

The application of the Competency Specification Process (CSP) to Task 2 illustrates how competencies can be systematically derived, structured, and contextualized to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical problem-solving in computing education. The competencies defined in this report provide a foundation for a competency-based learning model that promotes not only conceptual understanding and technical proficiency, but also the development of essential skills such as simulation, modeling, analytical reasoning, and collaborative reporting.

By aligning learning objectives with real-world tasks, the CSP fosters meaningful and transferable learning experiences, equipping students with the competencies needed to tackle authentic challenges in the field of computer science.
